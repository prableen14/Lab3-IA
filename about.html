            <p>The University of Windsor DSC is all about helping students build their skills and their resume with
                fantastic community projects and interesting workshops! Join the club and meet new people on our discord
                server: https://discord.gg/XUjp4bX. As part of the program, these students referred to as leads work
                with
                their colleges to launch a student club at their campus and collaborate with local partners to build
                solutions for the next billion users, with a little help from Google. </p>
